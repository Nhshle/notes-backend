# Notes backend

The Notes backend implements a RESTful HTTP interface and handles the management of notes. It is developed using Node and Express. The purpose is to develop a backend that works with the [frontend](https://github.com/Nhshle/notes-frontend.git).

## Running the application on your own machine

You can easily try out the application on your own machine. The current version of the application is developed using Node version 22.3.0. For the best experience, it is recommended to use the same major version of Node, but the application will likely work with other Node versions as well.

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. Clone this repository to your own machine with the command `https://github.com/Nhshle/notes-backend.git`

2. Navigate to the cloned repository with the command `cd notes-backend`

3. Install the node modules with the command `npm install`

4. Start the application with the command `npm run dev`. By default, the application will start on port 3001, so it will be available at http://localhost:3001/.
